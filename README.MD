# DCE Tools

This project provides DCE tools written in different languages (Perl, Python for now) to help developers experiment with the DCE and to see what the response would be like. This is NOT for
PRODUCTION USE. 
To see what DCE is, please refer to https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/docs/displayable_content_export/ for details.
