# Export Tools

The Bazaarvoice Export tool was created to help developers experiment with Bazaarvoice export APIs ([DCE](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/displayable-content-export),[PSI](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/product-sentiment-insights-api/home)). The example applications are meant as both a reference implementation of how to use the Bazaarvoice export APIs, as well to get an idea on the content that is available. The sample is written in different languages (Node.js, Python, etc.). 

To see what Displayable Content Export is, please refer to the Bazaarvoice [documentation](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/displayable-content-export) for details.

## Reference Tools
Bazaarvoice export APIs are HTTP-protocol based API, and as such, is not bound to any specific programming language. Your application might be written in Java, javascript, Ruby, Python, Perl, C#, C++, or any other programming language in which HTTP requests can be made over the internet.

The reference languages contained in this project are simple examples of how one might interact with export content. These examples are not meant for production use. Your implementation will require exception handling, HTTP retries in case of network failures, etc.
