# DCE Tools

This project provides Bazaarvoice Displayble Content Export tools written in different languages (Node.js, Python, etc.) to help developers experiment with the Displayalbe Content Export and to see what the response would be like. These example applications are meant as both a reference implementation of how to use the Bazaarvoice API, as well to get an idea of the format of the retrieved data.

To see what Displayble Content Export is, please refer to the Bazaarvoice [documentation](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/displayable-content-export) for details.

## Reference Tools
The Displayable Content Export is an HTTP-protocol based API, and as such, is not bound to any specific programming language. Your application might be written in Java, javascript, Ruby, Python, Perl, C#, C++, or any other programming language in which HTTP requests can be made over the internet.

The reference languages contained in this project are simple examples of how one might interact with the Displayable Content Export. These examples are not meant for production use. Your implementation will require exception handling, HTTP retries in case of network failures, etc.
